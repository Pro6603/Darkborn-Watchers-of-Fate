Darkborn: Watchers of Fate
DWOF is a new game that i am working on. it is my first project using C# .NET 10, and doesnt use top level statements.
I am relativley new to programming, and i am happy to learn new things on the way!

Things, that the code offers:
- "Render Helper": Custom Dynamic Rendering API: used to render:
  - Textboxes, Dialogues, Headers, Loading Screens, Weapon Contexts, and a few other things.

- Readable code (mostly):
  - The project is structured under multiple folders and cs files, wich is good because there arent gonna be any 1k+ lines of code in a singular file,
    exept in the main game loop most likeley.

Feel free to look at the code, and use it yourself!
